# ComprehensiveDataset.ForAcousticDroneDetection
The rapid proliferation of drones across various industries has introduced significant challenges related to privacy, 
security, and noise pollution. Current drone detection systems, primarily based on visual and radar technologies, face 
limitations under certain conditions, highlighting the need for effective acoustic-based detection methods. This paper presents
a unique and comprehensive dataset of drone acoustic signatures, encom- passing 28 different categories differentiated by brand 
and model. The dataset includes raw audio recordings, spectrogram plots, and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) plots for 
each drone. Additionally, we introduce an interactive web application that allows users to explore this dataset by selecting specific 
drone categories, listening to the associated audio, and viewing the corresponding spectrogram and MFCC plots. This tool aims to 
facilitate research in drone detection, classification, and acoustic analysis, supporting both technological advancements and educational 
initiatives. The paper details the dataset creation process, the design and implementation of the web application, and provides experimental results 
and user feedback. Finally, we discuss potential applications and future work to expand and enhance the project.
